## <a name="basic-overview"> </a> Basic overview
The script receives a phrase that you want to encode or decode using a simple encryption method called: Caesars cipher. You input the phrase, the shift amount and you choose between the option to decode or encode. A special feature of the script is called: Brute-force mode, which is explained down below.

## <a name="brute-force"> </a> Featured: Brute-force mode
The script contains a feature called brute-force mode. Brute-force mode goes through every shift in the English alphabet just in case you don't know the number of shifts that were made. It prints out every single possible shift of the letters in the phrase. It is used for decoding.
